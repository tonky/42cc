Reasoning for using Selenium:
============================
i honestly tried windmill, but it isn't launching an instance of firefox on my machine. i thinks it has something to do with the built-in mozrunner, because the stock one from pip works just fine.
btw, selenium server 2.0a5 wasn't working either, so i had to use 2.04a for server.



Running tests:
===================

1) Run Selenium server instance(i use xvfb):
  a) Start xvfb session:
    $ startx -- `which Xvfb` :1 -screen 0 1024x768x24 2>&1 >/dev/null

  b) Run Selenium server in xvfb:
    $ DISPLAY=:1 java -jar /opt/selenium/selenium-server-standalone-2.0a4.jar


2) Run tests normally from project folder:
    $ PYTHONPATH=..:. nosetests -P --with-django -w . -e django



Selenium installation:
=========================
Latest Selenium server(2.0a5) is buggy, so use previous one:

1) Install language bindings:
  pip install -U selenium

2) Get working server:
  $ mkdir /opt/selenium
  $ wget 'http://selenium.googlecode.com/files/selenium-server-standalone-2.0a4.jar' -P /opt/selenium
